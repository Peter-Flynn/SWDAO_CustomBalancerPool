	/// @dev Please see Balancer's IVault.sol for documentation on swaps.
	// Swap implementation is unique, and is composed internally using separate AMM methods:
	// 1) The first method applies to all tokens that are not the BPT, or SWD.
	//		• Tokens are bought and sold for the fair price dictated by the [ORACLE].
	//		• Buy versus sell price can be reported differently by the [ORACLE].
	//		• Tokens may run out entirely, and prices do not change according to balance
	//		  proportions (unlike Uniswap's constant-product method)
	//		• Tokens are maintained according to the set weights using a flat fee/bonus dictated by
	//		  the [slo6.balanceFee]. A user bringing the pool back into balance will receive a
	//		  bonus (reducing the BPT value), whereas a user bringing it out of balance will pay a
	//		  fee (increasing the BPT value). Balance is incentivized by offering rates different
	//		  from those in the wider market.
	//		• Fees due to the Balancer protocol are calculated by comparing the final output to a
	//		  hypothetical, feeless transaction.
	// 2) The second method applies to SWD.
	//		• SWD's price is calculated using the constant-product method (like Uniswap).
	//		• Rather than calculating against a single token (ex. WETH, USDC, etc.), SWD is 
	//		  compared to the entire sum of all other tokens in the pool (in USD).
	//		  With the BPT being "Token_0", and SWD being "Token_1":
	//
	//			Balance:		USD Sum:		Constant:
	//
	//							Token_2
	//			SWD		X		...			=	K
	//							Token_N
	//
	//		  Alternatively:
	//
	//			(SWD Price)×(SWD Balance) =
	//				(Token_2 Price)×(Token_2 Balance) + ... + (Token_N Price)×(Token_N Balance)
	//
	//		• Summing the USD value of all tokens can be gas-expensive, therefore future versions
	//		  of this contract should seek to make this process as efficient as possible, and care
	//		  should be taken when adding more tokens to the pool. A hard cap of 50 tokens has been
	//		  set within [ExtraStorage.MAX_TOKENS].
	// 3) The final method applies to the BPT.
	//		• Like SWD, the BPT's price is found through the summation of all value within the
	//		  pool, but rather than changing with balance proportions, the total pool value is
	//		  simply divided by the BPT's circulating supply.
	//
	//			USD Sum:		Balance:					USD Price:
	//
	//			Token_2
	//			...			/	(Circulating Supply)	=	BPT
	//			Token_N
	//
	//		• The BPT's circulating supply is found by subtracting the pool's balance from the
	//		  total supply, and then adding those tokens due as fees to the Balancer protocol, but
	//		  not yet issued.
	//
	//		  (Circulating Supply) = (Total Supply) - (Pool Balance) + (Due Protocol Fees)
	//
	//		• The process of the pool owner joining the pool with [JoinKindPhantom.INIT] mints the
	//		  initial supply of BPT, and deposits the initial balance within the pool. The total
	//		  balance remaining in the pool owner's wallet will equate 1-to-1 with every USD
	//		  (in value) deposited to the pool, excluding the value of the SWD. This gives the BPT
	//		  an initial value of $1.
	//		• As BPT are accounted for as they enter/leave the pool, the price of BPT will remain
	//		  constant for such transactions. The price of the BPT only changes if:
	//			1) The underlying tokens change in value.
	//			2) Trades are made with the SWD balance (thus changing SWD's value).
	//			3) The pool accumulates fees, or grants trade bonuses.
	//		  This makes the BPT's performance as an asset easy to understand for the end user.
	//		• Intuitively, one might expect that the BPT should be valued using double the pool's
	//		  total value, in order to account for the value of the pool's SWD. However, this would
	//		  be an error, as shown in the following scenario.
	//		  	1) A user owns all circulating BPT.
	//			2) That user sells half their BPT to purchase all tokens except the SWD.
	//			3) The user then sells zero BPT to purchase all the SWD which are now worth nothing.
	//			4) The user retains half their original BPT, while the pool is now empty.
	//		  Accounting for the BPT's price properly avoids such a possibility.
	// All complexity is abstracted away from the end user, and these solutions are compatible with
	// DEx aggregators. Trades from SWD to the BPT are not allowed directly, acting as an
	// artificial bias towards SWD's positive price-action.

    // they need not trust Pool contracts in any way: all security checks are made by the Vault. They must however be
    // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.
    //
    // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.
    // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),
    // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').
    // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together
    // individual swaps.
    //
    // There are two swap kinds:
    //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
    // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
    //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
    // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
    // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
    // the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
    // much less gas than they would otherwise.
    //
    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be
    // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the
